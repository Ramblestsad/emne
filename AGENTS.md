# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/main.rs` is the entry point for the CLI/binary.
- No dedicated `tests/` directory yet; add unit tests in-module (e.g., `src/foo.rs`) or integration tests under `tests/` when introduced.
- Build artifacts go to `target/` (generated by Cargo).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `cargo build`: compile the project in debug mode.
- `cargo run`: build and run the binary.
- `cargo test`: run all tests (unit and integration).
- `cargo fmt`: format code using repository rustfmt settings (`rustfmt.toml`).
- `cargo build --release`: compile with release profile (`opt-level=3`, `lto=true`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Rust edition: 2024 (see `Cargo.toml`).
- Formatting is enforced by `rustfmt.toml` (e.g., `max_width = 100`, `fn_args_layout = "Tall"`).
- Use standard Rust naming:
  - `snake_case` for functions, variables, and modules.
  - `PascalCase` for types and traits.
  - `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Prefer module files under `src/` with clear, single-purpose names (e.g., `src/config.rs`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Use Rust’s built-in test framework (`#[test]`).
- Name test functions descriptively, such as `renders_default_template`.
- No coverage targets are defined yet; keep tests focused on public behavior.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages follow a Conventional Commits-style prefix, e.g., `feat: add Cargo.toml and rustfmt.toml configuration files`.
- Keep PRs focused and include:
  - A concise description of the change and rationale.
  - Any relevant commands run (e.g., `cargo test`).
  - Screenshots or output snippets if behavior changes are visible.

## Agent-Specific Notes
- Keep edits concise and aligned with existing Rust and rustfmt conventions.
- Avoid adding new tooling unless it is necessary for the task.
